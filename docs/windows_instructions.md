## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError` despite the package being installed, try:
  ```bash
  pip uninstall [package-name]
  pip install [package-name]
  ```

- If you're having permission issues, try running Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator

- If you still have import errors, verify you're using the correct Python interpreter:
  ```bash
  where python
  # Should point to your virtual environment's .venv\Scripts\python.exe
  ```
